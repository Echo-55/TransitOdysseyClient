To be used in coordination with GMAK3R's Transit Odyssey server-side mod

Currently inter-op between server-side and client-side is yet to be implemented. This plugin serves as more of a proof of concept in its current form.

Project goal:
Client-side enabling/disabling of available locations based on previous raid extract location and possible paths to new locations.

TODO:
Implement functionality for determining which extracts lead to what
Test more edge case server-side modifications
